It is difficult with low-resource languages b/c they are not as diverse and don't have the vector space overlap with higher-resource languages. The goal below was to follow an example in an arvix paper (Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00440.pdf) which employed a method similar to that used in visual computing. They called it 'translation data augmentation' (TDA). It augments the training data by altering existing sentences in the parallel corpus, similar in spirit to the data augmentation approaches in computer vision. This study proposed a weaker notion of label preservation that allows to alter both source and target sentences at the same time as long as they remain translation of each other.
