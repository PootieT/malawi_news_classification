# malawi_news_classification
Low resource text classification

Welcome to the repo for final class project for CS 505 (NLP). In this project
we are tasked with this [Malawi News Classification dataset](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai4d-malawi-news-classification-challenge/leaderboard).
In limited time span, we tested a few techniques in data augmentation, creating / finetuning better embedding space
with Transformer-based models, as well as some data science techniques to boost performance in feature space.

## Baseline models:
