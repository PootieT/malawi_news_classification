Two houses in the village were completely destroyed, killing or injuring the residents inside. According to the preliminary report known by Nariño’s Administrative Directorate for Disaster Risk Management (DAGRD), the event left 3 people dead and 5 people injured. Landslides in the area also blocked important roads.Jhon Rojas, the Governor of Nariño, along with a team from DAGRD Nariño visited the area to support the coordination of an emergency response. The governor said heavy rainfall had increased the risk of landslides in rural areas, putting families at risk. Some have evacuated their homes as a precaution. The governor added that assistance has been provided to affected communities and work on clearing or repairing roads has begun.'"

We met. We met at a school in Chiradzulu In Malawi.\\n Even in the fall of a country locust destroys plants and other crops, on the other hand it is a blessing because if they are, beetles are also good for the human body because they are high in protein and zinc and iron, nutrients that help build the body, according to research. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\\n Despite the ban, locusts are being sold in markets such as Limbe and Blantyre. It was reported on July 22 this year that the locusts have landed at Nyamula Scheme in Nsanje District and are on their way from Bangula to Chikwawa. that\\'s it! With famine and famine looming in these two states many could not help but thank God for sending locusts to destroy them. Why, many are found weak and some are already dead! Warning messages not to return the locusts because they have been sprayed with pesticides to prevent further damage to the plant in the Shire, but some have been reluctant to stop picking and roasting the locusts and eating them.\\n Nsanje District Senior Chief Malemia and Chikwawa District Security Committee Chairman Mike Kalula confirmed the incident to Msangulutso.\\n The message has spread everywhere that we should not eat the locusts because they are sprayed. But some of them still pick it up, wash it, and eat it. It is very dangerous, but we are still trying to advise them to stop eating the locusts, said Kalula.\\n The problem here is hunger. There is a severe famine and people cannot afford to eat the locusts when they have no means of subsistence, but they should not. Better a poor horse than no horse at all.\\n Malemia said the incident had taken them by surprise and called for people to stop eating locally infested locusts.\\n \"Reports of people washing locusts and eating them have come true, and we are scared because we could lose lives,\" Malemia said.\\n He said following a government ban, in Nsanje district people have stopped selling locusts but some are still selling them in secret.\\n When a product is banned, no one can sell it in public, and some may be selling it in secret but they should stop the practice because it has harmed people, he said.\\n The secretary general of the Ministry of Agriculture, Erica Maganga, said she was disappointed by the news and urged people to stop eating the locusts saying it could put their lives at risk.\\n This is another problem, we have banned people from eating locusts because they can cause problems. If the government has spoken out then it has seen the harm that people will experience if they eat locusts that have died of pesticides.\\n They may eat without noticing its effects, but this can affect them further, so they need to stop. \"We urge the media, the media and ourselves to spread the word so that people do not intentionally ruin their lives by locating locusts,\" said Maganga.\\n He said the ban on locusts and grasshoppers has affected the southern provinces as it is close to the Chikwawa and Nsanje districts that have been affected by the locust outbreak.\\n The problem is that they are flying objects, then you will find that they have reached Thambani and into Neno district which is close to the affected districts. So we urge all governments in the southern hemisphere not to eat these parasites. We are working with the police to prevent anyone from selling locusts or locusts, ”added Maganga.\\n A doctor, who asked not to be named because he did not speak for the health ministry, said the people were in danger if they actually ate the locusts.\\n There are risks associated with dizziness, itching, and fever due to the side effects of the drug, he said in response to what could happen to people who ate the spray locust.\\n Shire Valley ADD seed manager Ringstone Taibu said several hectares had been treated and work had been underway for three weeks.\\n In addition to not disrupting the farmers\\' crop, the locusts also ate sugarcane in the Illovo company\\'s fields which led to the spraying of pesticides.'"
